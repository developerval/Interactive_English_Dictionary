# Interactive English Dictionary written in Python

## Objective

### Create a Python script that will take user input and given that input exists within data.json, output the definition of that word. If the word doesn't exist, suggest similar words that could be misspelt or exit the program gracefully

## Modules used

### json & difflib

## Notes

### data.json is a large (~5MB) file that github won't display, it's essentially just a huge json file of terms and definitions used for this project
